# ibm_recommendation_engine
My solution to the Udacity Nano degree Project "Recommendations with IBM".

- i slightly changed the test files:
  1. I transformed the column names (article ids) to integer which made more sense in my eyes
  2. One of the tests contained the word "movies" instead of "articles" which had to be corrected!
